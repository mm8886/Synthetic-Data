### Feature Engineering Documentation for Channel Preference Prediction Pipeline

#### Feature Engineering Techniques Used (All)

- *1. Channel Response Rate Calculation*  
  Computes per-channel response rates for SMS, Email, Call, WhatsApp, IVR, and Field Agent by measuring how often usage of each channel leads to positive customer outcomes such as connection, payment, or promise to pay.  
  Purpose: Quantifies channel effectiveness on a per-customer basis, facilitating personalized communication strategies.

- *2. Channel Usage Frequency Indicators*  
  For each channel, a binary usage indicator is included representing whether the customer was contacted via that channel.  
  Purpose: Captures customer exposure to different communication channels historically.

- *3. Digital Savviness Score*  
  Normalizes and averages digital engagement metrics (App_Login_Frequency, UPI_Transactions, Online_Banking_Activity), along with binary flags for WhatsApp usage and high smartphone penetration, creating a unified digital activity score.  
  Purpose: Measures customer digital comfort and adoption, influencing channel preference.

- *4. Customer Time Preference Encoding*  
  Encodes customer preferred contact times (morning, afternoon, evening, night) based on flags in the dataset, mapping these categorical preferences into numeric codes (0-3).  
  Purpose: Enables time-of-day targeting aligned with customer availability or preferences.

- *5. Historical Contact Frequency Normalization*  
  Computes normalized frequencies of historical contact attempts per channel (Call, SMS, WhatsApp, Email) by dividing each count by the maximum observed value.  
  Purpose: Reflects engagement levels and possible saturation or fatigue effects per communication mode.

- *6. Customer Segment Creation*  
  Segments customers into four categories—High_Value_Digital, Traditional, Young, and Senior—based on income, digital savviness score, and normalized age. Default segment is Standard.  
  Purpose: Enables differentiated marketing and communication based on demographic and behavioral patterns.

- *7. Preferred Channel Feature Engineering*  
  Extracts the dominant preferred communication channel for each customer and counts the number of channels marked as preferred.  
  Purpose: Captures explicit customer channel affinities for targeted outreach.

- *8. Feature Selection Including Customer Identifier*  
  Selects a curated set of important features across demographics, digital behavior, channel metrics, loan attributes, and customer segments, always preserving the customer identifier (Customer_id) for tracking.  
  Purpose: Provides a focused and relevant feature set for downstream modeling or analysis, ensuring traceability.

- *9. Customer ID Preservation Throughout Pipeline*  
  Adds a dedicated step ensuring the Customer_id column is preserved unchanged throughout all transformations, reattaching it if inadvertently dropped.  
  Purpose: Maintains data integrity and ability to link features back to original customers.
